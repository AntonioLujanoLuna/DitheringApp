Halftone Dithering App Project - GitHub Pages Version
Project Overview
The Halftone Dithering App is a client-side web application that allows users to apply various halftone dithering effects to their images. Halftone dithering simulates continuous tone imagery through dots varying in size, spacing, or color to create gradient-like effects. All image processing and storage happen within the user's browser, making this app completely functional without any backend services.
Core Functionality
User Experience

Image Input

Users can upload images from their device
Drag and drop functionality
Paste directly from clipboard
Real-time processing of images


Dithering Controls

Algorithm selection (Ordered, Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, Halftone)
Dot size adjustment (1-10px)
Contrast adjustment (0-100%)
Color mode selection (B&W, CMYK, RGB, Custom)
Spacing and angle adjustments for halftone patterns


Preview and Download

Side-by-side preview of original and processed images
Real-time updates as settings are adjusted
One-click download of processed images


Local User Collections

Save processed images to browser storage
View, manage, and delete saved images locally
Apply settings from saved images to new uploads
Persistence limited to current browser/device


Local Preset System

Save combinations of settings as named presets in browser storage
Apply presets with a single click
Manage local preset library
Import/export presets as JSON files for manual sharing


Shareable Links

Generate unique URLs with settings encoded in URL parameters/hash
Direct link sharing via social media
QR code generation for physical sharing
Links contain rendering instructions, not the images themselves



Technical Functionality

Image Processing Pipeline

Canvas-based image manipulation
Real-time processing with optimized algorithms
Client-side rendering of all effects


Dithering Algorithms

Ordered Dithering: Using Bayer matrices for threshold mapping
Floyd-Steinberg: Error diffusion approach for natural-looking gradients
Atkinson: Modified diffusion algorithm popular in older Mac systems
Classic Halftone: Simulates traditional printing techniques with dots


Color Processing

Grayscale conversion and thresholding
Color separation for CMYK mode
RGB channel processing
Optional custom color palette implementation


Progressive Web App Features

Offline capability for continued use without internet
Installable on mobile and desktop devices
Background processing for larger images
Local storage for preset and image saving



Project Architecture
Frontend Structure

Core Components

Main App Container: Overall app state and navigation
Image Editor: Handles image processing and UI controls
Settings Panel: User interaction with algorithm parameters
Preview Component: Displays original and processed images
Local Collection Viewer: Browser-stored images and settings
Preset Manager: Creation and application of setting presets
Export/Import Tools: For transferring presets between users


UI Organization

Tab-based navigation between Editor and My Collection
Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
Sidebar for controls, main area for image preview


State Management

Current image and processing parameters
Application UI state (active tab, modals, etc.)
Local collection pagination and filters
Local preset collection and selected preset



Backend Architecture
No Backend: This application is designed for static hosting (GitHub Pages) and operates entirely client-side. There is no backend server, database, or user authentication system.

Client-Side Storage

localStorage: For smaller data like presets and app settings
IndexedDB: For larger data including processed images
File downloads: For exporting processed images and presets


Data Persistence Strategy

All data persists only within the user's browser
Import/export functionality for transferring data between devices
Clear explanation to users about the local-only nature of storage



Deployment Architecture

Frontend Hosting (GitHub Pages)

Static site hosting from GitHub repository
Automatic deployment on push to designated branch
Free custom domain configuration if desired
Global CDN distribution via GitHub's infrastructure


Repository Structure

Source code in main branch
Build output in docs/ folder or dedicated gh-pages branch
Proper configuration of base path in build tool


Deployment Process

Configure GitHub repository for Pages deployment
Set up build script (npm run build) to generate static assets
Configure Vite with correct base path for GitHub Pages subdirectory
Push changes to trigger automatic deployment
Verify proper HTTPS configuration



Monetization Strategy
A simplified monetization approach due to the absence of a community platform:


Ad Placement (Optional)

Minimal, non-intrusive banner on editor page
Clear distinction between app content and advertisements
Privacy-respecting ad providers only



Technical Implementation Details

Development Stack

Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS
Build System: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
Backend: None (Client-Side Only)
Storage: Browser APIs (localStorage, IndexedDB)
Deployment: GitHub Pages
PWA: Workbox for service worker implementation


Key Libraries/Dependencies

React for UI components
Canvas API for image processing
localforage or idb for improved IndexedDB interaction
Service worker libraries for offline capabilities
QR code generation library for shareable links


Data Flow

Image upload → Canvas processing → Preview rendering
Save action → Browser storage → Collection view
Settings export → URL parameters → Shareable link
Preset application → Parameter update → Re-rendering


Analytics Implementation

Privacy-focused analytics (Plausible, Umami, or SimpleAnalytics)
Collection of non-identifying metrics:

Popular effects and algorithms
Feature usage patterns
Performance measurements





Future Expansion Potential

Enhanced Algorithms

Additional dithering techniques
More sophisticated color processing


Migration Path to Full-Stack

Architecture designed to allow future integration of backend services
Clear separation of UI and data logic for easier backend addition
Potential for gradual integration of Supabase or similar for community features


Expanded Local Features

Batch processing of multiple images
Advanced export options and formats
Extended preset capabilities



Security and Privacy Considerations

Data Security

All user data stays on their device
No transmission of images to external servers
Clear communication about storage limitations


Image Processing Security

Client-side processing (no server vulnerability)
Proper validation of uploaded content
Memory management for large images


Analytics Privacy

No personally identifiable information
Aggregate data only
Compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations
Option for users to opt out



This revised project plan focuses on creating a powerful client-side tool that leverages GitHub Pages for free, fast deployment while maintaining the core image processing functionality. While community features are removed, the app provides a complete dithering experience with local storage options and shareable links for effect settings.
