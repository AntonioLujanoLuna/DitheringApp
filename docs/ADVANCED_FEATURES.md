# Advanced Features Documentation

This document describes the advanced features implemented in the Dithering App.

## Web Worker Implementation

The Dithering App offloads CPU-intensive operations to Web Workers to prevent UI freezing during complex operations. This implementation includes:

- A modular worker system that handles multiple types of tasks
- Proper message-passing interface with typed messages
- Transferable objects for efficient memory management
- Automatic region detection using edge detection algorithms

### Usage Example

```typescript
// Create a worker
const worker = new Worker(
  new URL('../lib/workers/ditheringWorker.ts', import.meta.url),
  { type: 'module' }
);

// Set up message handler
worker.onmessage = (event) => {
  if (event.data.type === 'processImageResult') {
    // Handle processed image data
  }
};

// Send a task to the worker
worker.postMessage({
  type: 'processImage',
  imageData: imageData,
  algorithm: 'floydSteinberg',
  // ... other parameters
});
```

## WebAssembly Integration

Core dithering algorithms have been compiled to WebAssembly for maximum performance:

- TypeScript interface for interacting with WASM modules
- Memory management utilities for transferring image data
- High-performance implementations of popular algorithms
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { floydSteinbergDitheringWasm } from '../lib/wasm/ditheringWasm';

// Process an image with WASM-accelerated algorithm
async function processWithWasm(grayscale, width, height) {
  try {
    const result = await floydSteinbergDitheringWasm(grayscale, width, height);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('WASM processing failed, falling back to JS implementation');
    // Fall back to JavaScript implementation
    return floydSteinbergDithering(grayscale, width, height);
  }
}
```

## Progressive Web App Support

The application is now a fully-featured PWA with offline capabilities:

- Service worker with sophisticated caching strategies
- Manifest for installation on devices
- Offline functionality for previously visited pages
- Background sync for saved images when connectivity is restored

### Caching Strategies

1. **Network First with Cache Fallback** - Used for API requests to ensure fresh data while providing offline fallback
2. **Cache First with Network Update** - Used for static assets like images and fonts
3. **Stale-While-Revalidate** - Used for HTML and other resources to provide immediate response while updating in the background

## Advanced Region Selection

The selective dithering feature has been enhanced with:

- Automatic object detection using edge detection algorithms
- Sophisticated region tools for precise selection
- Different algorithms can be applied to different regions
- Interactive canvas-based interface for manipulating regions

### Creating Custom Regions

1. Upload an image
2. Click "Detect Objects" to automatically identify regions
3. Click on a region to select it
4. Choose the desired algorithm for the selected region
5. Apply the selective dithering effect

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:

1. Machine learning-based object detection for more accurate regions
2. Additional WebAssembly-optimized algorithms
3. Support for animated GIF processing with frame-by-frame editing
4. Cloud synchronization for saved projects
